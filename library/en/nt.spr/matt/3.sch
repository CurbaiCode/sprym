In those days came <John the Baptist>, preaching in the wilderness of Judæa,
And saying, <Repent> ye: for the <kingdom> of heaven <is at hand>.
For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet <Esaias>, saying, The <voice> of one crying in the wilderness, <Prepare> ye the way of the Lord, make his <paths> straight.
And the same John had his <raiment> of <camel’s> hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was <locusts> and wild honey.
Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judæa, and all the region round about Jordan,
And were baptized of him in Jordan, <confessing> their sins.

But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his <baptism>, he said unto them, O <generation of vipers>, who hath <warned> you to flee from the wrath to come?
^Bring forth therefore fruits <meet for> <repentance>:
And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham <to<| our> father>: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.~`Why is it that ye receive not the preaching of him whom God hath sent? If ye receive not this in your hearts, ye receive not me; and if ye receive not me, ye receive not him of whom I am sent to bear record; and for your sins ye have no cloak.`
`Repent, therefore, and` bring forth fruits meet for repentance;
And think not to say within yourselves, `We are the children of Abraham, and we only have power to bring seed unto our father Abraham;` for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children `into` Abraham./^
And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which <bringeth> not forth good fruit is <hewn> down, and cast into the fire.
^I indeed <baptize> you with water unto <repentance>: but <he> that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not <worthy> to bear: he shall <baptize> you with the Holy Ghost, and<| with> <fire>:
Whose <fan><| is> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the <garner>; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable <fire>.~I indeed baptize you with water, `upon your` repentance; `and when he of whom I bear record cometh, who is` mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear, `(or whose place I am not able to fill,) as I said, I indeed baptize you before he cometh, that when he cometh he may` baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire.
`And it is he of whom I shall bear record,` whose fan `shall be` in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but `in the fullness of his own time` will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
`Thus came John, preaching and baptizing in the river of Jordan; bearing record, that he who was coming after him had power to baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire.`/^

Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be <baptized> of him.
But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
^And Jesus answering said unto him, <Suffer><| it to be so> now: for thus it <becometh us> to <fulfil> all <righteousness>. Then he suffered him.
And Jesus, when he was <baptized>, went up <straightway> out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the <Spirit> of God descending like a <dove>, and lighting upon him:
And lo a <voice> from heaven, saying, This is my <beloved> <Son>, in whom I am well pleased.~And Jesus, answering, said unto him, Suffer `me to be baptized of thee,` for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
`And John went down into the water and baptized him.`
And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water; `and John saw,` and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon `Jesus`.
And lo, `he heard` a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. `Hear ye him.`/^
